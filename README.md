Example of an API created with Goa based on: https://goa.design/docs/3-tutorials/1-rest-api/

Also added config for CORS and serving openapi3.yaml to make the openapi doc available for swagger-ui.

>[!CAUTION]
> CORS config is allowing everything just to make it easy to run both the api and and swagger-ui on localhost with different ports
